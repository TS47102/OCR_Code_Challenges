# OCR_Code_Challenges
Responses to the [OCR 2016 Coding Challenges Booklet](https://www.ocr.org.uk/Images/260930-coding-challenges-booklet.pdf).

This repository will include both GCSE-level responses (A Command-line application with commands for each challenge), and A-level responses (A desktop application with GUI for each challenge).

Some challenges are relatively infeasible to do via a Command-line application however, due to requiring complex graphics, so the GCSE command-line app may lack support for these challenges.

Some challenges are duplicates of previous challenges (Eg. #1 - 'FactorialFinder' and #45 - 'Find the Factorial'). In these cases, the user interface for the duplicated challenges in the command-line and desktop applications will refer to the same code-behind.
