# OCR_Code_Challenges
Solutions for the [OCR 2016 Coding Challenges Booklet](https://www.ocr.org.uk/Images/260930-coding-challenges-booklet.pdf).
This repository will include both GCSE-level responses (A Command-line application with commands for each challenge), and A-level responses (A WPF application with GUI for each challenge).
Some challenges are relatively infeasible to do via a Command-line application however, due to requiring complex graphics, so the GCSE command-line app may lack support for these challenges.
Some challenges are duplicates of previous challenges (Eg. #1 - 'FactorialFinder' and #45 - 'Find the Factorial'). In these cases, only the first appearance of the challenge will be present.
